# To the TA and Others Concerned

Due to file size limitations, I am unable to upload my `train_data` and `test_data` files after translation and LDA processing. Therefore, you will need to download the original datasets and remove all comments related to the LDA and preprocessing steps at the beginning of the code. Running these steps will take approximately 1 hour to generate the results.

Alternatively, you can download the processed files from the following links:
